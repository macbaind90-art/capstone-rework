  <h1>David Macbain</h1>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, my name is David. I am an Army veteran who is beginning to learn
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is one of my first projects, and it
    shows that I understand some basic concepts in web development.
  </p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I live in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I am married and have three boys
    who are 17, 12, and 9 months old. My family motivates me to learn new
    skills and build a better future.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of my interests include competitive shooting, IoT, and learning
    more about technology.
  </p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I served in the U.S. Army as a Sergeant with two deployments to Iraq.
    I also have experience in security operations and training in the
    civilian world.
  </p>

  <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
  <p>
    I have always been interested in technology, but only recently started
    learning it seriously. My goal is to grow my skills and eventually work
    in a tech-related role.

    One of the challenges in changing careers is balancing work, family,
    and learning new skills. I am taking it step by step and improving a
    little every day.
