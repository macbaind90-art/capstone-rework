              I’m based in <strong>Tuscaloosa, Alabama</strong>, married, and a
              proud dad to three boys—<strong>17</strong>, <strong>12</strong>,
              and a <strong>9-month-old</strong>. My family is a huge part of
              why I push myself: every career move, every late study session,
              and every new skill is about building a stronger future for them.

              I’ve spent years leading teams in high-stakes environments,

              operations. That background shaped me into a leader who is
              <strong>curious</strong>, <strong>driven</strong>, and
              <strong>passionate</strong> about solving problems and helping
              people perform at a higher level.

            <p>
              I’ve always been interested in technology, but only recently had
              the opportunity to fully pursue it. After years of building and
              leading training programs, managing complex operations, and
              solving real-world problems, I see tech as the next evolution of
              that same mission—using tools, data, and code to make systems
              smarter and people safer.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to take the mindset I developed in the Army and in
              security operations—structured thinking, tactical awareness, and
              calm under pressure—and apply it to software, cybersecurity, and
              modern IT environments.

              Transitioning out of the military and deep into security work
              taught me how to operate when the stakes are high and the path
              isn’t always clear. The hardest part of shifting into tech has
              been balancing responsibility to my family with the time and
              focus needed to learn new skills. It’s a real challenge—but it’s
              also exactly why I’m committed to this path.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m approaching tech the same way I approached training and
              operations: with a plan, measurable goals, and a commitment to
              continuous improvement.

              I’m looking to bridge my operational and training background into
              a meaningful role in tech. VetsWhoCode stands out because it’s
              built by and for veterans who understand what it means to learn
              under pressure, work as a team, and own the mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the next 6–12 months, I’m focused on building real,
              deployable skills in software and related technologies—skills I
              can use to contribute to teams, support my family, and eventually
              mentor other veterans making the same transition.
